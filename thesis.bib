Our approximation is twofold: we propose a set of music descriptors that can automatically be extracted from the audio signals, and a top-down approach that adds explicit and formal semantics to these annotations. Music descriptors are generated in two ways: as derivations and combinations of lower-level descriptors and as generalizations induced from manually annotated databases by the intensive application of machine learning. We believe that merging both approaches (bottom-up and top-down) can overcome the existing semantic gap in the musical domain.{\textless}br /{\textgreater} {\textless}br /{\textgreater}

  Abstract                 = {Traditional clustering algorithms are inapplicable to many real-world problems where limited knowledge from domain experts is available. Incorporating the domain knowledge can guide a clustering algorithm, consequently improving the quality of clustering. In this paper, we propose SS-NMF: a semi-supervised non-negative matrix factorization framework for data clustering. In SS-NMF, users are able to provide supervision for clustering in terms of pairwise constraints on a few data objects specifying whether they ``must'' or ``cannot'' be clustered together. Through an iterative algorithm, we perform symmetric tri-factorization of the data similarity matrix to infer the clusters. Theoretically, we show the correctness and convergence of SS-NMF. Moveover, we show that SS-NMF provides a general framework for semi-supervised clustering. Existing approaches can be considered as special cases of it. Through extensive experiments conducted on publicly available datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of SS-NMF for clustering.},

This technique explicitly models the three-dimensional ballistic motion of objects in free-flight and the two-dimensional projection of the trajectory into the image plane of a static or moving camera. Deviations from this model provide evidence of manipulation. The technique assumes that the object's trajectory is substantially influenced only by gravity, that the image of the object's center of mass can be determined from the images, and requires that any camera motion can be estimated from background elements. The computational requirements of the algorithm are modest, and any detected inconsistencies can be illustrated in an intuitive, geometric fashion. We demonstrate the efficacy of this analysis on videos of our own creation and on videos obtained from video-sharing websites.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a new approach for locating forged regions in a video using correlation of noise residue. In our method, block-level correlation values of noise residual are extracted as a feature for classification. We model the distribution of correlation of temporal noise residue in a forged video as a Gaussian mixture model ({GMM).} We propose a two-step scheme to estimate the model parameters. Consequently, a Bayesian classifier is used to find the optimal threshold value based on the estimated parameters. Two video inpainting schemes are used to simulate two different types of forgery processes for performance evaluation. Simulation results show that our method achieves promising accuracy in video forgery detection.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently developed video editing techniques have enabled us to create realistic synthesized videos. Therefore, using video data as evidence in places such as courts of law requires a method to detect forged videos. In this study, we developed an approach to detect suspicious regions in a video of a static scene on the basis of the noise characteristics. The image signal contains irradiance-dependent noise the variance of which is described by a noise level function ({NLF)} as a function of irradiance. We introduce a probabilistic model providing the inference of an {NLF} that controls the characteristics of the noise at each pixel. Forged pixels in the regions clipped from another video camera can be differentiated by using maximum a posteriori estimation for the noise model when the {NLFs} of the regions are inconsistent with the rest of the video. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method by adapting it to videos recorded indoors and outdoors. The proposed method enables us to highly accurately evaluate the per-pixel authenticity of the given video, which achieves denser estimation than prior work based on block-level validation. In addition, the proposed method can be applied to various kinds of videos such as those contaminated by large noise and recorded with any scan formats, which limits the applicability of the existing methods.},

In this paper we propose an approach to detect suspicious regions in video recorded from a static scene by using noise characteristics.

We propose to use order constrained solutions in K-means clustering to stabilize the results and improve the interpretability of the clustering. With this method a further improvement of the misclassification error in the aforementioned instrument recognition task is possible. Using order constrained K-means the musical structure of a whole piece of popular music can be extracted automatically. Visualizing the distances of the feature vectors through a self distance matrix allows for an easy visual verification of the result. For the estimation of the right number of clusters, we propose to calculate the adjusted Rand indices of bootstrap samples of the data and base the decision on the minimum of a robust version of the coefficient of variation. In addition to the average stability (measured through the adjusted Rand index) this approach takes the variation between the different bootstrap samples into account.

  Abstract                 = {Verifying the integrity of digital images and detecting the traces of tampering without using any protecting pre-extracted or pre-embedded information have become an important and hot research field. The popularity of this field and the rapid growth in papers published during the last years have put considerable need on creating a complete bibliography addressing published papers in this area. In this paper, an extensive list of blind methods for detecting image forgery is presented. By the word blind we refer to those methods that use only the image function. An attempt has been made to make this paper complete by listing most of the existing references and by providing a detailed classification group.},

The objectives are to determine unauthorized cut-and-splice or cut-insert-splice operation and quantify the extent of such editing. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can identify cut start and duration down to single frame precision. The approach embeds a watermark with a strong timing content, violation of which can be traced back to the parameters of the editing operation},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we propose {SULFA} (Surrey University Library for Forensic Analysis) for the benchmarking of video forensic techniques. This new video library has been designed and built for the purpose of video forensics specifically related to camera identification and integrity verification. As far as we know, no such library or similar currently exists in the community. {SULFA} contains original as well as forged video files, which will be freely available through the University of Surrey's website. There are approximately 150 videos collected from three camera sources, which are Canon {SX220} (codec H.264) [1], Nikon S3000 (codec {MJPEG)} [2] and Fujifilm {S2800HD} (codec {MJPEG)} [3]. Each video is approximately 10 seconds long with resolution of 320 {\#x00D7;240} and 30 frames per second. All videos have been shot after carefully considering both temporal and spatial video characteristics. In order to present life-like scenarios, various complex and simple scenes have been shot with and without using camera support (tripod). Furthermore 9 original videos from each source in {SULFA} have been tested with Photo Response Non Uniformity ({PRNU)} based camera identification methods. Currently, {SULFA} also includes videos with cloning or copy-paste forgery. Each forged video includes full information of the doctored region.},

  Abstract                 = {With the advent of the ubiquitous era, context-based music recommendation has become one of rapidly emerging applications. Context-based music recommendation requires multidisciplinary efforts including low level feature extraction, music mood classification and human emotion prediction. Especially, in this paper, we focus on the implementation issues of context-based mood classification and music recommendation. For mood classification, we reformulate it into a regression problem based on support vector regression (SVR). Through the use of the SVR-based mood classifier, we achieved 87.8\% accuracy. For music recommendation, we reason about the user's mood and situation using both collaborative filtering and ontology technology. We implement a prototype music recommendation system based on this scheme and report some of the results that we obtained.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the ease with which digital information can be altered, many digital forensic techniques have been developed to authenticate multimedia content. Similarly, a number of anti-forensic operations have recently been designed to make digital forgeries undetectable by forensic techniques. However, like the digital manipulations they are designed to hide, many anti-forensic operations leave behind their own forensically detectable traces. As a result, a digital forger must balance the trade-off between completely erasing evidence of their forgery and introducing new evidence of anti-forensic manipulation. Because a forensic investigator is typically bound by a constraint on their probability of false alarm (P\_fa), they must also balance a trade-off between the accuracy with which they detect forgeries and the accuracy with which they detect the use of anti-forensics. In this paper, we analyze the interaction between a forger and a forensic investigator by examining the problem of authenticating digital videos. Specifically, we study the problem of adding or deleting a sequence of frames from a digital video. We begin by developing a theoretical model of the forensically detectable fingerprints that frame deletion or addition leaves behind, then use this model to improve upon the video frame deletion or addition detection technique proposed by Wang and Farid. Next, we propose an anti-forensic technique designed to fool video forensic techniques and develop a method for detecting the use of anti-forensics. We introduce a new set of techniques for evaluating the performance of anti-forensic operations and develop a game theoretic framework for analyzing the interplay between a forensic investigator and a forger. We use these new techniques to evaluate the performance of each of our proposed forensic and anti-forensic techniques, and identify the optimal actions of both the forger and forensic investigator.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the ease with which digital information can be altered, many digital forensic techniques have recently been developed to authenticate multimedia content. One important digital forensic result is that adding or deleting frames from an {MPEG} video sequence introduces a temporally distributed fingerprint into the video can be used to identify frame deletion or addition. By contrast, very little research exists into anti-forensic operations designed to make digital forgeries undetectable by forensic techniques. In this paper, we propose an anti-forensic technique capable of removing the temporal fingerprint from {MPEG} videos that have undergone frame addition or deletion. We demonstrate that our proposed anti-forensic technique can effectively remove this fingerprint through a series of experiments.},

The resulting authentication code is sensitive to malicious modifications of video data but resilient to allowed lossy compression processes, such as H.264/advanced video coding ({AVC).} The integrity of video content can thus be guaranteed if the extracted feature matches the transmitted authentication code.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a novel video forgery detection technique to detect the spatial and temporal copy paste tampering. It is a challenge to detect the spatial and temporal copy-paste tampering in videos as the forged patch may drastically vary in terms of size, compression rate and compression type (I, B or P) or other changes such as scaling and filtering. In our proposed algorithm, the copy-paste forgery detection is based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients ({HOG)} feature matching and video compression properties. The benefit of using {HOG} features is that they are robust against various signal processing manipulations. The experimental results show that the forgery detection performance is very effective. We also compare our results against a popular copy-paste forgery detection algorithm. In addition, we analyze the experimental results for different forged patch sizes under varying degree of modifications such as compression, scaling and filtering.},

  Abstract                 = {With the innovations and development in sophisticated video editing technology, it is becoming increasingly significant to assure the trustworthiness of video information. Today digital videos are also increasingly transmitted over non secure channels such as Internet. Therefore in surveillance, medical and various other fields, video contents must be protected against attempt to manipulate them. This paper presents an intelligent video authentication algorithm using support vector machine, which is a non-linear classifier. The proposed algorithm does not require the computation and storage of any secret key or embedding of any watermark. It computes the local information of the difference frames of given video statistically and classifies the video as tampered or non-tampered. It covers both kinds of tampering attacks, spatial and temporal. It uses a database of more than 4000 tampered and non-tampered video frames and gives excellent results with 99.12 classification accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {With the advent of high-quality digital video cameras and sophisticated video editing software, it is becoming increasingly easier to tamper with digital video. A growing number of video surveillance cameras are also giving rise to an enormous amount of video data. The ability to ensure the integrity and authenticity of these data poses considerable challenges. We describe two techniques for detecting traces of tampering in deinterlaced and interlaced video. For deinterlaced video, we quantify the correlations introduced by the camera or software deinterlacing algorithms and show how tampering can disturb these correlations. For interlaced video, we show that the motion between fields of a single frame and across fields of neighboring frames should be equal. We propose an efficient way to measure these motions and show how tampering can disturb this relationship.},

Questions of discrimination and preference by listeners and players require additional studies using the techniques of experimental psychology, and these are also touched on in the paper. To address the concerns of players and makers of instruments requires study of the interaction of all these factors, coming together in the concept of 'playability' of an instrument.},

  Abstract                 = {A new approach for detecting video logo-removal forgery is proposed by measuring inconsistencies of blur. Our approach is based on the assumption that if a digital video undergoes logo-removal forgery; the blurriness value of the forged region is expected to be different as compared to the non-tampered parts of the video. Blurriness is estimated by the regularity properties in the wavelet domain which involves measuring the decay of wavelet transform coefficients across scales. The distribution of blurriness value in a forged video is modeled as a {GMM} (Gauss mixture model). The {EM} (Expectation-Maximization) algorithm is employed to estimate the model parameters. Consequently, a Bayesian classifier is used to find the optimal threshold value. Experimental results show that our approach achieves promising accuracy in logo-removal forgery detection.},

Among 65 contributions to the academic literature, eight themes were proposed, with duration (62\% of authors), intentionality (41\%), cause (31percnt;), consequences (31\%), and function (18\%) the most frequently cited. When the eight themes cited by both academics and non-academics were rank ordered, approximately 60\% overlap in opinion was evident. A data-derived summary of emotion-mood distinctions is provided. These data should prove useful to investigators interested in developing a clearer scientific distinction between emotion and mood than is currently available.}},

  abstract  = {Content-based music information retrieval tasks are typically solved with a two-stage approach: features are extracted from music audio signals, and are then used as input to a regressor or classifier. These features can be engineered or learned from data. Although the former approach was dominant in the past, feature learning has started to receive more attention from the MIR community in recent years. Recent results in feature learning indicate that simple algorithms such as K-means can be very effective, sometimes surpassing more complicated approaches based on restricted Boltzmann machines, autoencoders or sparse coding. Furthermore, there has been increased interest in multiscale representations of music audio recently. Such representations are more versatile because music audio exhibits structure on multiple timescales, which are relevant for different MIR tasks to varying degrees. We develop and compare three approaches to multiscale audio feature learning using the spherical K-means algorithm. We evaluate them in an automatic tagging task and a similarity metric learning task on the Magnatagatune dataset.},

  abstract  = {This study deals with the acoustical factors liable to account for expressiveness in clarinet performances. Mechanical and expressive performances of excerpts from Bach's Suite No. II and Mozart's Quintet for Clarinet and Strings were recorded. Timbre, timing, dynamics, and pitch descriptors were extracted from the recorded performances. The data were processed using a two-way analysis of variance, where the musician's expressive intentions and the note factors were defined as the independent variables. In both musical excerpts, a strong effect of the expressive intention was observed on the timbre (attack time, spectral centroid, odd/even ratio), timing (intertone onset intervals) and dynamics (root mean square envelope) descriptors. The changes in the timbre descriptors were found to depend on the position of the notes in the musical phrases. These results suggest that timbre, as well as timing and dynamics variations, may mediate expressiveness in the musical messages transmitted from performers to listeners.},
